# Frontend

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 21.2.6.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

## Theming

The application supports light and dark themes with a ChatGPT-inspired design aesthetic.

### Theme System

The theming system uses CSS custom properties (variables) defined in `src/styles.scss`. Semantic tokens are used for consistent styling across light and dark modes:

| Token | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `--color-bg` | Main background |
| `--color-surface` | Card/component surfaces |
| `--color-surface-elevated` | Elevated surfaces (modals, dropdowns) |
| `--color-border` | Border color |
| `--color-text` | Primary text |
| `--color-text-secondary` | Secondary text |
| `--color-text-muted` | Muted/disabled text |
| `--color-primary` | Primary accent color |
| `--color-primary-dark` | Primary hover/active color |
| `--color-error` | Error/danger color |
| `--color-success` | Success color |
| `--color-warning` | Warning color |

### Theme Toggle

- Theme toggle button is located in the header, next to authentication controls
- Click the sun/moon icon to switch between light and dark modes
- Theme preference is persisted in localStorage under the key `app-theme`
- On first load, the system checks:
  1. Saved user preference (if previously selected)
  2. System `prefers-color-scheme` media query (if no saved preference)
  3. Defaults to light mode

### Dark Mode Design

The dark mode features:
- Near-black background (#0f0f0f) for reduced eye strain
- Charcoal surfaces (#1a1a1a) with subtle elevation
- Soft borders (#2e2e2e) for definition without harshness
- Indigo accent (#6366f1) for interactive elements
- Muted text colors for hierarchy and readability
- Smooth transitions between themes

### Adding New Themeable Components

When creating new components, use CSS variables instead of hardcoded colors:

```scss
.my-component {
  background-color: var(--color-surface);
  color: var(--color-text);
  border: 1px solid var(--color-border);
}
```

Avoid hardcoded colors like `#ffffff`, `#000000`, or specific hex values. Use the semantic tokens for consistency.

### Theme Persistence

Theme preference is stored in `localStorage` and read before the app initializes to prevent flash of unstyled content (FOUC). The initialization script in `index.html` applies the correct theme immediately.
